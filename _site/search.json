    "text": "Our broadest goal is to figure out how the universe works. But even just thinking of such a massive task is stunning! We have to narrow our focus, at least initially.\nTherefore we will restrict attention to physics for the first several chapters, as this is the easiest thing to study. Even more specifically, we will start by considering gravity, which in fact will be our object of study for at least three chapters.\nEven at that, just what the hell is gravity and how can we study it? It is not visible, so we can only observe its influence on visible, measurable objects. To keep things as simple as possible, imagine holding some object out at shoulder-level and releasing it so that it falls to the ground.\nThis is called free fall. Technically we could say that there are various forces acting on the object during free fall: most significantly, the force of air resistance. However, we will hope that this and any other forces that might act on the object can be approximated as zero, and not affect our analysis too much.\nSo for the first few chapters we will be concerned with understanding free fall. Aristotles hysics It can be hard to know where to get started, so history can give us a convenient and interesting starting point. Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and one of the most important figures in the history of science — in fact he was, perhaps, the most important figure until the Scientific Revolution in the 16th century (which is about 18 centuries after his death!).\nAristotle claimed that a body in free fall will fall at a speed which is proportionate to its weight. We will call the following hypothesis Aristotle’s hypothesis of free fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle’s Hypothesis of Free Fall\n\n\n\nA body in free fall will fall at a rate proportionate to its weight.\n\n\nFrom a modern perspective, this is a hilariously wrong idea! For one thing, we now know that weight does not vary with the speed of free fall in a direct way.\nBut besides that, this expression makes it sound as though objects fall at a constant rate! This latter seems immediately, almost tangibly untrue. If you fall from a greater height, you seem to fall faster, not at the same rate as you travel when you start falling. At the very least, the impact is greater and that seems to have something to do with moving faster.\nOne can in fact devise a test to show that this theory cannot be right.\n\n\nDevise a test to demonstrate that Aristotle’s Hypothesis of Free Fall is wrong.\nHint: A consequence of his hypothesis is that an object always falls at a constant speed (since it has constant weight). Measure the time that it takes an object to fall if you release it from 3 feet off of the ground. Then measure it if you release it from 6 feet.\nSince the speed is constant, then according to the theory, the time that it falls through 6 feet should be twice the time that it falls through 3 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the free fall algebra\n\n\n\nMathematically prove the principle that we used above.\nMore exactly, suppose an object travels at a constant speed \\(s\\) through a distance \\(d\\), and let \\(t_1\\) be the time elapsed. Then it travels at the same constant speed \\(s\\) through a distance \\(2d\\), and let \\(t_2\\) be the time elapsed on this leg of the trip.\nUsing the relationship “distance equals rate times time” as it is often known in the US, prove that the above implies \\(t_2=2t_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConduct the test\n\n\n\nNow actually drop an object from the two different heights and reflect upon what you found. Drop it from three different heights if you have any doubts.\nIn particular, reflect on all of your concerns about the nature of this test. How could your own test be in error, and what could you do to reduce the error of your test?\nMore philosophically: Could there ever be a test or measurement without any possible error?"
